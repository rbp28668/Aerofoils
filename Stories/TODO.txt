BUGS

Edit Wing dialog - Root and Tip edit buttons have inconsistent positions. FIXED

Plot - moves are being drawn as lines  FIXED.

Fix or remove new core in plot FIXED (removed, now redundant)

Edit Wing Flags dialog - plot section button misaligned. FIXED

Not obvious that the select item is highlighted FIXED

Doesn't make sense to have transform for a G-Code snippet FIXED

Sending commands when disconnected hangs Cutter. FIXED, now produces an error message.

Possible to get into an odd mode where the serial data read from the cutter is being buffered after a comms failure.  i.e. send a command but receive the status from the previous command.


Improvements

Separate cut of top and bottom from either direction  DONE

Also, remove root and tip dialogs and add their contents into Edit Wing. DONE

Filter G-Code output to skip zero distance moves. DONE

Have all the G-Code related stuff in Cutter menu rather than some in File menu. DONE

Adaptive step size in cutter for G-code output- start large and reduce step in U until error in x/y < 0.5*resolution. DONE

Plan view of cutter when width and block position defined DONE


Rotate tapered wing to make TE parallel to edge of block DONE

Make ellipse tool offset aware.


Extend scope of DXF import - include blocks.
